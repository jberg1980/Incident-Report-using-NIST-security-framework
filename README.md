<h2>Summary:</h2>
The multimedia company experienced a distributed denial of service attack which compromised the internal network. The cybersecurity team found that the malicious actor flooded the network with ICMP packets causing the network to stop responding. The incident management team blocked the incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services and restoring critical network services.
